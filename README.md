## About Me
Hi there! I’m currently a CS major but I already have an associate degree from my first round through college about ten years ago. I graduated from DCC back in 2013 with a General Studies degree and the full intent to return to college one day – something that obviously got delayed by a whole decade! Aside from the standard Comp Sci classes, I currently work in the IT Service Desk here on campus and I am pretty well self-taught when it comes to hardware. I have a background in front-end web development and I’m excited to learn more about the backend! I’ve also been working on a small 3D puzzle jumper game in my spare time, and I’ve learned a ton about data structures and C# from it. 

## The Gameplan
I fully plan to continue making sites and web apps, so I’ll incorporate everything I learn in this class into my personal projects going forward. I most often make browser-based games, plus the occasional utility to support our dnd games!
